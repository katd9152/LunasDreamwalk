1.4:

- Enhancement: Pony levels can now be set to blue stars, meaning the pony has
               enough XP to level up, but not yet played the "flying game" for
               that level. This should help with quests that demand getting a
               pony to a specified level.

1.3:

- Enhancement: Use tabs for better usability
- Enhancement: Ability to set pony levels

1.2:

- Bugfix: the calculation of a CRC32 checksum has been fixed, which had caused
          the creation of broken savegames in 6-7% of attempts.
- first version uploaded to github 

1.1:

- Enhancement: accept Android_Id instead of IMEI for Android tablets


1.0 (first release):

- parse savegame files for Android phones and iDevices and allow basic
  modifications such as various currencies and removal of obstacles
